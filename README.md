# :books: moth-stories
Scraped stories from the [story library](https://themoth.org/story-library/stories) of [The Moth](https://themoth.org/), an organization dedicated to storytelling.
The Moth's online story library was difficult to browse through due to its strict pagination, so I combined the stories into a CSV to enable endless scrolling and search capabilities.

:pushpin: In the future, I may analyze the stories to see if there are any common themes, speakers, etc.
